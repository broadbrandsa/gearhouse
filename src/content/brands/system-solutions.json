    "overview": "System Solutions designs, manufactures, and integrates large-format LED displays and audiovisual systems, delivering permanent and semi-permanent installations as a specialist capability within the Gearhouse Group.",
    "what_delivers": "System Solutions provides end-to-end LED display manufacturing and AV systems integration for environments where reliability, visual performance, and long-term operational stability are critical. This includes stadiums, venues, public spaces, corporate environments, and specialist installations requiring bespoke engineering and local manufacturing support.\n\nUnlike rental-focused offerings elsewhere in the group, System Solutions operates in the space of ownership, permanence, and lifecycle management, supporting clients from specification and design through installation, maintenance, and eventual replacement.",
    "decision_context": "The decision is whether to invest in short-term installations or commit to systems designed for long-term reliability, support, and lifecycle value. Buyers are choosing an infrastructure partner, not just hardware.",
    "how_it_fits": "System Solutions is the group’s permanent infrastructure and manufacturing depth. It enables Gearhouse to move beyond temporary or event-based delivery into long-term, fixed installations, strengthening the group’s ability to support clients across the full lifecycle of their technical environments.\n\nWithin a land-and-expand model, System Solutions typically becomes relevant once a client’s needs stabilise, scale, or justify capital investment.",
