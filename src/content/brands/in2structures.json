    "overview": "In2Structures delivers engineered structural and staging solutions for complex, large-scale events, operating as a specialist capability within the Gearhouse Group.",
    "what_delivers": "In2Structures provides engineered temporary and semi-permanent structures for events, broadcast productions, exhibitions, and large-scale activations. Its value lies in solving structural challenges where safety, compliance, precision, and load-bearing performance are non-negotiable.\n\nThe brand is typically engaged when standard staging or modular systems are insufficient, and when structural integrity becomes a core project risk rather than a background consideration.",
    "decision_context": "The buyer is deciding whether structural feasibility and safety are managed proactively by specialists or handled reactively through incremental fixes. This is a risk and liability decision, not a creative one.",
    "how_it_fits": "In2Structures is the group’s structural and engineering depth. It enables Gearhouse to confidently take on technically complex builds without relying on external structural suppliers, strengthening accountability and reducing delivery risk.\n\nUnlike most other specialist brands in the group, In2Structures operates with a higher degree of digital independence, including a multi-page website and its own footer. Operationally, however, it remains a critical internal capability within the Gearhouse delivery ecosystem.",
