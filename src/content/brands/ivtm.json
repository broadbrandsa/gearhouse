    "overview": "IVTM provides permanent, on-site technical management and equipment services for venues, convention centres, hotels, and entertainment spaces, operating as a specialist capability within the Gearhouse Group.",
    "what_delivers": "IVTM delivers ongoing venue-based technical management, supplying both equipment and skilled personnel to ensure venues remain operational, current, and technically capable on a day-to-day basis. Unlike event-specific suppliers, IVTM operates as an embedded partner, integrating directly into a venue’s operations.\n\nIts value lies in continuity, uptime, and institutional knowledge. IVTM removes the operational burden of managing in-house technical infrastructure, staffing, and last-minute technical demands, allowing venues to focus on commercial and guest experience outcomes.",
    "decision_context": "The buyer is deciding whether to run technical operations in-house or adopt a managed operating model that transfers risk, staffing complexity, and continuity responsibility to a specialist partner.",
    "how_it_fits": "IVTM is the group’s permanent venue operations specialist. It enables Gearhouse to extend beyond project-based delivery into long-term operational partnerships, embedding the group inside venues where events and productions recur.\n\nWithin the group ecosystem, IVTM often acts as an anchor relationship, creating downstream opportunities for other Gearhouse capabilities as venue needs evolve.",
