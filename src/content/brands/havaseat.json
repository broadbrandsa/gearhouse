    "overview": "Havaseat delivers modular grandstand seating systems for prestigious events, broadcasts, and large-scale public gatherings, operating as a specialist capability within the Gearhouse Group.",
    "what_delivers": "Havaseat provides engineered, temporary grandstand seating solutions designed for speed of assembly, audience safety, comfort, and visual quality. Its systems are purpose-built for environments where audience infrastructure must be deployed quickly, meet strict safety standards, and integrate cleanly into high-profile event settings.\n\nThe brand’s value lies in removing risk around audience accommodation. Seating failures, poor sightlines, noise, or safety issues directly impact event reputation, broadcast quality, and regulatory compliance. Havaseat addresses these risks through engineered systems rather than improvised structures.",
    "decision_context": "The buyer is choosing between improvised audience infrastructure and engineered seating systems that prioritise safety, speed, and spectator experience.",
    "how_it_fits": "Havaseat is the group’s audience infrastructure specialist. It enables Gearhouse to take ownership of spectator accommodation as part of a broader event delivery brief, rather than relying on third-party seating providers.\n\nWithin the group ecosystem, Havaseat typically integrates with structures, staging, lighting, and production management, ensuring that audience experience and safety are treated as core delivery components rather than add-ons.",
