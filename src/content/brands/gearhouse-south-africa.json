    "overview": "Gearhouse South Africa is the group’s South African delivery engine for technical production, supplying crew, equipment, and operational delivery across live events, venues, and broadcasts. It is often the execution layer behind complex briefs, with the group’s specialist brands extending capability where deeper solutions are required.",
    "what_delivers": "Gearhouse South Africa delivers large-scale technical event production across South Africa, combining equipment, crew, planning, and on-site execution. Its value is delivery certainty under pressure. When timelines are tight, audiences are large, and reputational risk is high, Gearhouse South Africa reduces the chance of failure by running production with experienced teams, proven processes, and the backing of the wider group.",
    "how_it_fits": "Gearhouse South Africa is the primary South African delivery arm of the Gearhouse Group. It handles broad technical production delivery and acts as the most common entry point for local briefs. When a brief requires specialist depth (structures, LED manufacturing, seating, scenic build, venue technical management, communications), the wider group brands plug in as internal extensions of the same delivery model.",
    "decision_context": "The buyer is choosing between coordinating multiple suppliers or appointing one team to run delivery end-to-end. This is a risk, accountability, and reputation decision.",
    "brand_limitations": "Gearhouse South Africa should not position itself as a commodity supplier or compete on line-item pricing. Its strength is delivery certainty, scale, and accountability.",

      {
        "gap": "Group strength is implied, not explained",
