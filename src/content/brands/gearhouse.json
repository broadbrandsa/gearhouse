    "overview": "Gearhouse is the primary entry point into the group, positioned to take ownership of complex event, venue, and production challenges by bringing the right specialists together across its operating companies.",
    "what_delivers": "Gearhouse delivers end-to-end technical production capability for live events, venues, broadcast environments, and large-scale activations. Its core value is not any single service, but the ability to take full responsibility for delivery across multiple disciplines, suppliers, and operational risks.\n\nFor buyers, Gearhouse represents a reduction in coordination complexity, supplier risk, and things going wrong, particularly in high-stakes or time-critical environments.",
    "how_it_fits": "Gearhouse is the umbrella brand and should function as the group’s main lead driver. While specialist brands provide depth and category expertise, Gearhouse is the brand that should attract problem-level demand and turn it into a clear plan and deliver it using the group’s internal capabilities.\n\nIn practice, Gearhouse is the “front door” through which many clients should enter, even if the initial requirement ultimately maps to a specialist solution.",

      ],
      "channel_copy": "This messaging should primarily live at the group level, across the main Gearhouse website and senior-facing touchpoints. It should be used selectively in channels where decision-makers seek reassurance rather than discovery, such as direct outreach, proposal framing, and targeted visibility to senior stakeholders. Copy should focus on owning outcomes, absorbing risk, and simplifying delivery, rather than enumerating capabilities. The role of content is to build confidence, not generate volume.",

    "broadbrand_intervention": {
      "constraint": "Gearhouse is trusted for delivery at scale, but is often engaged after clients have already fragmented responsibility across multiple suppliers.\n\nBy the time Gearhouse enters the conversation, complexity, risk, and accountability are already high, limiting its ability to shape the overall solution from the outset.\n\nThis positions Gearhouse as an integrator of complexity rather than the default entry point that removes it.",
      "intervention": "BroadBrand would help reposition Gearhouse as the starting point for complex, high-stakes briefs by reframing its role around accountability, risk ownership, and simplification.\n\nWe would translate Gearhouse’s full-stack capability into clearer, problem-led narratives that resonate at executive and procurement level, where responsibility and outcome ownership matter most.\n\nThis includes structuring group-level messaging so specialist brands are positioned as deliberate extensions of a single accountable delivery model.",
