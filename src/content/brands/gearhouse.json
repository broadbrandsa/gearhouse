    "overview": "Gearhouse is the primary entry point into the group, positioned to take ownership of complex event, venue, and production challenges by orchestrating specialist solutions across its operating companies.",
    "what_delivers": "Gearhouse delivers end-to-end technical production capability for live events, venues, broadcast environments, and large-scale activations. Its core value is not any single service, but the ability to assume accountability for delivery across multiple disciplines, suppliers, and operational risks.\n\nFor buyers, Gearhouse represents a reduction in coordination complexity, supplier risk, and delivery uncertainty, particularly in high-stakes or time-critical environments.",
    "how_it_fits": "Gearhouse is the umbrella brand and should function as the group’s primary demand engine. While specialist brands provide depth and category expertise, Gearhouse is the brand that should attract problem-level demand and convert it into structured delivery using the group’s internal capabilities.\n\nIn practice, Gearhouse is the “front door” through which many clients should enter, even if the initial requirement ultimately maps to a specialist solution.",

        "title": "Problem-led search",

      {
        "title": "Referrals and repeat engagements",

        "title": "Credibility validation",

      "primary": "Senior decision-makers responsible for high-risk, high-visibility delivery, including corporate event leads, agencies, broadcasters, venue operators, and public-sector stakeholders.",
      "motivators": "These buyers are motivated by risk reduction, accountability, and outcome certainty. They choose Gearhouse when the cost of failure outweighs the cost of consolidation. A single accountable partner reduces internal friction and reputational exposure.",

        "gap": "No guided journeys for differnt buyer types",
        "impact": "Different buyers have different decision criteria, approval processes, and risk sensitivities. Without guidance, some will struggle to quickly see relevance.",

      },
      {
        "gap": "Specialist brands not clearly positioned as an internal system",
        "impact": "Buyers may still perceive risk associated with multi-supplier coordination, even when those suppliers sit within the same group.",
        "improvement_opportunity": "Reinforce the idea that specialist brands are internal extensions of one delivery model, not separate vendors."

        "gap": "Proof exists, but is not structured as decision support",

        "improvement_opportunity": "Structure proof to support internal justification, not just external reassurance."
      }
    ],
    "brand_limitations": "Gearhouse should not position itself as a commodity service provider or compete on isolated line-item pricing. Its strength lies in orchestration, accountability, and scale, not in tactical execution alone.",
    "performance_leakage": "The site demonstrates strong technical credibility and accessibility, which supports enterprise trust. Performance is acceptable but not exemplary for a high-impact conversion surface. Lead quality and conversion are more affected by clarity of positioning and buyer guidance than by technical constraints.",

      "Audit Rec: No broader channel expansion required."
    ],
    "land_expand": "Many Gearhouse clients begin with a specific problem but later encounter additional needs across staging, structures, AV, communications, or long-term infrastructure."
