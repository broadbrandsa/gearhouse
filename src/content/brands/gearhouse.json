    "overview": "Gearhouse is the primary entry point into the Gearhouse Group, taking ownership of complex, high-risk production challenges across live events, venues, and broadcast environments in South Africa.\n\nWhen delivery matters, timelines are tight, and failure carries reputational or financial risk, Gearhouse brings the right people, systems, and specialist capability together under one accountable delivery model.",
    "what_delivers": "Gearhouse delivers end-to-end technical production across large-scale live events, venues, and broadcast environments. This includes planning, equipment, crew, coordination, and on-site execution.\n\nIts value is not any single service, but the ability to take responsibility for delivery across multiple disciplines. Gearhouse reduces the risk that comes from managing many suppliers by acting as one accountable production partner, especially in high-pressure or high-visibility environments.",
    "how_it_fits": "Gearhouse is the umbrella brand and main lead driver for the group. It is the front door through which complex or uncertain briefs should enter.\n\nWhen deeper specialist capability is required, group companies such as structures, LED, seating, scenic build, venue technical management, or communications plug in as internal extensions of the same delivery model, not as separate vendors.",
