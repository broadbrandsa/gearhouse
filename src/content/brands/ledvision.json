    "overview": "LEDvision delivers large-format, high-brightness LED screen rental and visual display solutions for live events, broadcast productions, and high-visibility environments, operating as a specialist capability within the Gearhouse Group.",
    "what_delivers": "LEDvision provides modular and mobile LED video technology designed for environments with high ambient light, where visibility, reliability, and visual impact are critical. The brand specialises in turnkey delivery, including screens, support structures, power, signal distribution, and technical operation.\n\nIts value is strongest in situations where failure is highly visible, timelines are compressed, and visual clarity directly affects audience experience or broadcast outcomes.",
    "decision_context": "The buyer is choosing between visual impact with execution certainty versus experimental or under-resourced solutions. This is a reputational risk decision where failure is public and immediate.",
    "how_it_fits": "LEDvision is the group’s visual display and daylight screen specialist. It strengthens Gearhouse’s ability to deliver visually dominant experiences without relying on third-party LED suppliers, particularly for outdoor, broadcast, and large-scale public events.\n\nWithin the group, LEDvision often operates as a high-impact module that integrates closely with staging, structures, audio, and production management.",
