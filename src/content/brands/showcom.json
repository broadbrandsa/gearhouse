    "overview": "ShowCom provides specialist communications and connectivity solutions for live events and productions, operating as a capability within the Gearhouse Group.",
    "what_delivers": "ShowCom delivers mission-critical communications infrastructure for live events, productions, and complex operational environments. This includes event communications systems where coordination, safety, and real-time responsiveness are essential.\n\nThe value of ShowCom is not visibility or scale, but operational certainty. When communications fail, events stall, safety risks increase, and delivery breaks down. ShowCom exists to remove this risk area.",
    "decision_context": "The decision is whether live communications and coordination are treated as an afterthought or embedded as a critical safety and operational layer.",
    "how_it_fits": "ShowCom is the group’s communications and coordination specialist. It underpins delivery across all other Gearhouse capabilities by ensuring crews, production teams, and stakeholders remain connected during live operations.\n\nWithin the group ecosystem, ShowCom functions as an enabling layer rather than a headline service, but its absence would significantly increase operational risk across productions.",
