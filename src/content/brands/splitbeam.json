      "constraint": "Splitbeam’s lead quality is strong, but discovery is heavily relationship-led and assumes prior understanding of long-term rental benefits.\n\nThis limits growth to existing networks and slows adoption among adjacent buyers experiencing the same operational pain.",
      "intervention": "BroadBrand would help reframe Splitbeam’s offering around predictability, lifecycle cost control, and operational stability.\n\nMessaging would contrast long-term rental against short-term hire, helping buyers self-identify earlier in the decision journey.\n\nThis would be done without expanding channels, focusing on clarity within existing validation touchpoints.",
