    "overview": "Splitbeam is a specialist theatre and long-run rental partner, providing equipment rental, long-term leasing, and technical production support for theatres, schools, touring shows, and performance venues. It operates as part of the Gearhouse Group.",
    "what_delivers": "Splitbeam delivers theatre-focused equipment rental, long-term leasing, and technical production services designed for environments where consistency, uptime, and specialist knowledge of performance spaces matter. It supports lighting, audio, rigging, and audiovisual requirements without the financial and operational burden of ownership. Its value is predictable delivery over time, with equipment that is maintained, available, and fit for theatre realities.",
    "how_it_fits": "Splitbeam is the theatre and long-run rental specialist within the Gearhouse Group. Clients often engage Splitbeam for a specific theatre requirement, but the wider group enables a production to scale into larger venues, touring formats, broadcast environments, or multi-discipline delivery without adding new suppliers.",
    "decision_context": "The decision is whether to own and maintain equipment internally or partner with a specialist who provides consistency, predictability, and technical continuity over time.",
